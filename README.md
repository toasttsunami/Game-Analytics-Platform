# Game Analytics Platform

This project is a full-fledged Game Analytics Platform built with Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize (PostgreSQL), and plain JavaScript for the frontend. The platform tracks player metrics, provides AI-powered game recommendations, and performs sentiment analysis on game reviews.

## Features

- **Player Behavior Tracking:** Track player metrics such as time spent playing, levels completed, and their game history.
- **Game Recommendations:** Simple game recommendation system based on player history.
- **Sentiment Analysis on Reviews:** Analyze user reviews to gauge player satisfaction using sentiment analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Plain JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **Sentiment Analysis:** `sentiment` package for basic sentiment scoring of reviews

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL database

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-analytics-platform.git
   cd game-analytics-platform
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database:

   - Create a PostgreSQL database:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE game_platform;
     ```

   - Update the PostgreSQL connection settings in `models/index.js`:

     ```javascript
     const sequelize = new Sequelize('game_platform', 'your-username', 'your-password', {
         host: 'localhost',
         dialect: 'postgres'
     });
     ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## API Endpoints

### Player Analytics

- `POST /analytics/track`: Track player actions (start game, end game, complete level).
- `GET /analytics/:playerId`: Get player analytics for a specific player.

### Game Recommendations

- `GET /recommendations/:playerId`: Get recommended games for a specific player.

### Review Sentiment Analysis

- `POST /reviews/analyze-review`: Submit and analyze a review for sentiment analysis.
- `GET /reviews/:gameId`: Get all reviews and their sentiment scores for a specific game.

## Frontend Interactions

- **Player Analytics:** Track a player's gaming behavior and view their statistics.
- **Game Recommendations:** View suggested games based on the player's gaming history.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Submit a game review and analyze the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative).

## TODOs / Future Improvements

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT or OAuth for secure access to player data.
   - Add user roles (admin, player) for role-based access control.

2. **Advanced Game Recommendations:**
   - Integrate a machine learning model to suggest games based on player behavior and preferences using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

3. **Better Analytics:**
   - Create more advanced analytics for players, including session length breakdowns, level difficulty analysis, etc.
   - Visualize player statistics using graphs (e.g., with Chart.js).

4. **Sentiment Analysis Improvements:**
   - Improve the sentiment analysis system by integrating a more sophisticated NLP model, such as a custom-trained model using TensorFlow.js or integrating a third-party API like IBM Watson.

5. **Player Leaderboards:**
   - Implement player leaderboards based on metrics such as time played, levels completed, or sentiment rating.

6. **Real-time Tracking:**
   - Add WebSocket support for real-time player activity tracking and analytics updates.

7. **Testing:**
   - Add unit and integration tests using Jest and Supertest to ensure API functionality and reliability.

8. **Frontend Enhancements:**
   - Improve the UI/UX with a modern frontend framework like React or Vue.js.
   - Add responsive design and optimize for mobile devices.

9. **Deploy to Cloud:**
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for production usage.
